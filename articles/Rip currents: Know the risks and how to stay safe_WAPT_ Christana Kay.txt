Each year, nearly 100 people drown from rip currents along the U.S. coastlines, according to the United States Lifesaving Association, and over a third of these fatalities happen during the months of June and July. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, there have been at least 19 documented fatalities so far this year, with the most recent being on June 23, when a 29-year-old man drowned in Panama City Beach and a 60-year-old woman drowned in Hollywood Beach.The National Weather Service offices categorize surf zones based on three types of hazards: rip currents, high surf and sneaker waves.What is a rip current?A rip current is an area of water between the breaking waves and the tide where the water is moving away from the beach. The water flows into a powerful narrow, river-like channel that moves away from the shoreline at high speed. Many times, people will get trapped or pulled under when they enter a rip current. Rip currents are more likely to form at low spots or breaks between sandbars. Once the flow of the current passes through the narrow gap, it'll spread out, and the current will weaken.Sneaker waves can catch beachgoers by surprise and sweep someone into the water if strong enough.How to spot a rip currentBased on the hazard, beachgoers will see a flag flown indicating the level risk of being in the water. The flag can range from green, or low hazard, to red, or high hazard. When there is a rise in dangerous marine life, such as jellyfish or sharks, a purple flag will be flown. People can get the best vantage point from higher up, such as by the lifeguard tower, a pier or over the dunes. Look for a choppy channel that is darker in color and drastically different from the calmer surrounding water. If the current is strong enough, spectators may be able to point out water flowing away from the beach.How to survive a rip currentIf you see someone caught in a rip current, the best tip is to alert the lifeguard and call 911. Never enter the water to try to save someone stuck in a rip current unless you have a flotation device and a way to escape. If you find yourself trapped in a rip current, here's a few tips on how to survive:Try to relax. Rip currents won't pull you under. Most rip current drownings happen when people panic and try to swim directly towards the shore.Trying to swim against the rip current will use up energy. Imagine trying to swim against a current that is moving between 1 and 8 feet per second! Swim along the shoreline until you can no longer feel the pull of the current. Once freed, swim at an angle away from the current and towards the shore.If you feel you can't reach the shore, relax, face the shoreline and call or wave for help.When rip currents are more likely to occur:Greatest between April and OctoberStrongest at low tide when waves are breaking over the sandbar, especially in an area with a channel between two sandbarsOn nice days after a storm Click here for your coastal surf forecast.
